## Overview
Customer churn (the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company) directly impacts revenue, profitability, and long-term growth for telecommunications companies. A spike in churn rates would affect the overall performance of SyriaTel Telecom. By utilizing existing customer information, I will do a forecast on probable exits by customers. In turn, SyriaTel will be in a position to optimize customer retention strategies, maintain customer loyalty, and sustain competitive advantage by establishing the churn trends.

## Business Understanding

### Stakeholders
SyriaTel Telecom

## Business Problem
SyriaTel is experiencing customer churn leading to lost revenue, increased customer acquisition expenses and a reduction in market share. SyriaTel is unable to formulate retention plans due to lack of a clear understanding of customer churn and high-risk customers prediction leading to missed opportunities to improve customer experience, optimize retention, and preserve long-term profitability. This calls for a research on customers who are likely to exit SyriaTel.

To address this, I will develop a data-driven solution that:

- Identifies high-risk customers before they churn.
- Highlights key factors driving attrition.
- Lays out actionable insights to facilitate SyriaTel's implementation of selected retention strategies.
