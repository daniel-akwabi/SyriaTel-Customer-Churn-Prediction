Customer churn (the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company) directly impacts revenue, profitability, and long-term growth for telecommunications companies.

In turn, SyriaTel will be in a position to optimize customer retention strategies, maintain customer loyalty, and sustain competitive advantage by establishing the churn trends.
